# NOTES ABOUT THE 24/7 LOFI PODCAST CHANNEL

1. Each individual script pulls an RSS feed into an object, saves the last 5 episodes of each podcast involved into its own list
2. The RSS feed objects are then pulled into playlistCreate.py which combines all the lists and places them into a playlist, then shuffles the order so the podcasts are random
3. The playlist is then imported into vlcmediaplayer.py which ingests the playlist and starts the broadcast over the local machine, providing the audio feed for OBS.
